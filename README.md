- area of rectange
- perimeter of circle
- area of circle
- diagonal length (i.e., distance to opposite corner)

# TODO planning ideas for contributors:
- Needs improved user experience. Some suggestions are:
   - ability to input numbers
   - pick different operations to perform from a menu
   - error checking values, and responding safely
   - run on a loop
 - Needs more features. Some suggestions are:
   - Operations: plus, minus, subtract, divide
   - Comparison: max, min, absolute distance
   - Measurement: length, perimeter, volume
   - Indices: powers
   - Financial: profit, loss, simple interest, compound interest
   - Statistics: average, sample size, probability
   - Linear: calculating gradient
   - Trigonometry: tangent, sine, cosine
 - Anything else that could improve the calculator. Some thoughts are:
   - Perhaps it could solve simple algebra, although this might be too hard.
   - It could include other mathematical tools of use to Queensland students.
   - It could spell out numbers as words, to help with student literacy.
